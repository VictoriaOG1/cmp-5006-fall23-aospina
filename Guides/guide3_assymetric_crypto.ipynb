The electronic documents, which are called digital certificates, are an essential part of secure communication and play an important part in the public key infrastructure (PKI). The CA acts as a trusted third party—trusted both by the subject (owner) of the certificate and by the party relying upon the certificate. The primary role of the CA is to digitally sign and publish the public key bound to a given user. This is done using the CA’s own private key, so that trust in the user key relies on one’s trust in the validity of the CA’s key.

The registration authority (RA) is an integral part of a public key infrastructure (PKI), which is a system for the creation, storage, and distribution of digital certificates which are used to verify that a particular public key belongs to a certain entity. The RA is responsible for accepting requests for digital certificates and authenticating the entity making the request. The RA then passes the request to the CA for processing.

A CA publishes a CRL as a time-stamped list of revoked certificates and distributes it to all parties relying upon certificates issued by that CA. Each entry in a CRL contains the serial number of the revoked certificate and the revocation date. A CRL should be updated periodically, with older entries removed and the most recent revocations added. A CRL is signed by the CA so that a relying party can be sure that the information in the CRL has not been modified since it was published by the CA."

The electronic documents, which are called digital certificates, are an essential part of secure communication and play an important part in the public key infrastructure (PKI). The CA acts as a trusted third party—trusted both by the subject (owner) of the certificate and by the party relying upon the certificate. The primary role of the CA is to digitally sign and publish the public key bound to a given user. This is done using the CA’s own private key, so that trust in the user key relies on one’s trust in the validity of the CA’s key. If so indicated by the certificate issuer, the certificate will also list additional information about the subject, such as a company name, a country, an email address, etc."
